Sorting Algorithms:-

Actually sorting algorithms are 2 types:-

1. Comparison based:-

In this we will compare the value in the list or array.

ex:- 1. Bubble sort
  
     2. Insertion sort

     3. selection sort

     4. Quick sort -----
                      |------  are works under divide and conquer
     5. Merge sort -----

     6. Heap sort

2. Non - comparison based:-

In this they won't compare the element in the array or list.

ex:- 1. Count sort

     2. Radix Sort

     3. Bucket Sort

Also wE have two sorting algorithms:-

1. stable sort:- Relative order should be maintained after sorting algorithms.

ex:- dictionary contains

      d ={(4,2),(5,7),(4,3),(6,8)}
after applying some sorting algorithm's.

we should get {(4,2),(4,3),(5,7),(6,8)}

2. unstable sort:- vice versa for stable sort

we should get 

{(4,3),(4,2),(5,7),(6,8)}


In place and outplace sorting algorithms

In place:- We don't use any extra place to sort an array.

out place:- We will use extra place to sort an array.

ex:- Merge sort  (application of d&c)


Bubble sort 

It will work on the iterations and passes

time complexity is o(n^2)
